# Android SIM Change Detection
A simple way to help you detect if the user removes/inserts/modifies the SIMs on their device.   

This projects demonstrates implementation of SIM change detection using both broadcast receivers and Subscriber IDs. Both these methods require the permission **READ_PHONE_STATE**.  

While this is a sample implementation and we have asked the user for permission using native methods, we recommend better permission handling, maybe using libraries like [Permissions Dispacher](https://github.com/permissions-dispatcher/PermissionsDispatcher) when using **READ_PHONE_STATE** for real world projects.   

A detailed blog for explaining the process of implementing this project is available on Faanghut. For any issues or concerns, please raise an issue on the issues page of this repo.
